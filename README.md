## About ##

API for retrieving data about users, servers, applications.

## Usage ##

`Not available`

## Host your own with Render ##

- Due to some issues with hosting via `Vercel`, you will be using `Render` instead

You will need a [Render](https://render.com) account to host it.

1 - Clone this repo to a **private** repository

2 - Edit your `config.json` file to the required data

3 - Create a new `web service` and import the repository you just created, make sure you are logged in beforehand

4 - After you have deployed your app & installation has finished, you can visit the deployed app and use it anywhere you would like!

5 - Please be aware that Render's free plan provides 100GB bandwidth per month. So make sure you are the only one who accesses it.

## Host your own locally ##

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MEMEZNUT999/DiscordLookup.git
```
- and then setup `config.json`
```bash
$ npm install
```
```bash
$ node .

```
